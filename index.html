        <h1>Christian's Climbing Cornicopia!!!</h1>
        <h2>Hello Stranger</h2>
        <p>
        	In these troubling times I have taken refuge in the humid woods of southern Illinois.  Here you will find Jackson Falls home of the most climbing routes in the state.  There are 4 types of climbing in which one can participate at Jackson Falls: sport climbing, bouldering, trad climbing, and top roping.  I don't really know anythingn about trad climbing except that it freaks me out so I'll only  get into the other 3.  Also as a special bonus there's a small section on deep water free soloing which can be done at Kinkaid lake about an hour away from Jackson Falls.
        <p>
        <h3><a href="bouldering.html">Bouldering</a> </h3>
        <p>
        	Bouldering is a type of climbing that focuses on short but very diffcult routes.  No ropes are used as the climber is still relatively close to the ground but matts (called crash pads) are laid out to break a fall.  All the people not climbing are responsible for spotting the climber.  Their goal is to make sure that if the climber falls her feet are the first thing to hit the ground and when they do they land on the pads.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="sport.html">Sport Climbing</a></h3>
        <p>
        	Sport climbing is my favorit type of climbing.  It involves connecting a climber by rope to a belayer who stays on the ground to provide a counter weight in case of a fall.  The climber then clips his rope into bolts in the wall as he assends.  Thus if the climber falls the rope that is attached to him gets pulled tight between himself and his bellay partner and the highest bolt he has clipped into preventing him from hitting the ground.  It involes falling (and potentially swinging) farther than top rope climbing so can be kind of scary at first, but is often the only way to get up a wall.  It is sometimes called lead climbing because a first climber can sport climb to the top of a route then set a top rope anchor for anyone else to use on their ascent.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="top_rope.html">Top Rope</a></h3>
        <p>
        	Probably the safest form of outdoor climbing it is certainly what someone should start out doing.  Climbing outdoors without at least one person who is experienced in outdoor climbing is a crazy thing to do, so please don't.  When just starting out it makes a lot of sense to let an experienced friend sport climb a route and set a top rope anchor for the less experienced climbers to use.  A top rope anchor is simply when the rope starting at the bellayer asends the route to the two chains at the top, passing through them it then comes down  to be tied around the climber.  Using this method new climbers can be assured of their safety and prevent longer falls and swinging.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="dws.html">Deep Water Free Soloing</a></h3>
        <p>
        	There was recently a documentary released called "Free Solo" about Alex Honold climbing an 8,000 foot wall by himself and without a rope.  This is a crazy thing to do, but it was a very good movie.  Deep Water Free Soloing (also called Psychoblocking) is when a climber asends a wall with no rope but if she falls will land in deep water and thus (hopefully) avoid both death and maiming.  It's probably still pretty dangerous, I don't know.  As a good rule of thumb you should always think critically through a route before climbing it; being tied to a rope might not be enough to prevent you from hitting a ledg that juts out from a wall for example.  Dangerous or not it's super fun and available (miraculously) in the great state of Illinnois.
